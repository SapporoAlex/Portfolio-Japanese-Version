        <p>January ~ April, 2024</p>
        <p id="description-text">After consulting with Kyoto Machiyas Ltd. I identified ways to boost productivity and increase accuracy. Because the company needed up-to-date information related to bookings and earnings, I created 3 tools for them to use. Firstly, I made a daily automated script to scrape daily hotel bookings data from the company database, and email the information to the relevant staff. Secondly, I created a weekly earnings report script that scrapes data from 2 databases, cleans the data, performs desired operations on figures and displays data in an easy to understand chart. The third tool I made was an email parser. Potential clients for Kyoto Machiyas fill out reservation forms on the homepage and send emails to the staff inbox. To ensure all emails were properly recieved and read in a timely manner, I wrote an email parser that can extract all relevant information from the email, and add them to an excel table, that is sent to the staff updated every 24 hours. The email parser parses both Japanese and English emails alike. I continue to consult with Kyoto Machiyas to create new ways to improve their business.

            <h2 id="subtitle">Made for Titan GreenTech</h2>
            <p>March, 2024</p>
            <p id="description-text">The CEO of Titan GreenTech, a recruiting company in Tokyo, asked if I could assist with creating a data visualisation tool. I developed some drafts and we discussed what might be the best solution. The CEO wanted a way to show charts of his employees KPIs every Monday, as well as view each employee's resume to placement ratio by quarter. He had the information in table format on his database, but wanted a quick and efficient way to get up-to-date easy to visulaise information. I wrote a script to scrape the employee data from the database, insert it into tables, update charts by week, and automatically email the data in an Excel sheet weekly. The CEO now still uses this visualisation tool to get insights into the progress of his employees and give better guidance.

It keeps track of staff who are clocked-in or clocked-out and what time they did so. It allows up to 20 staff members to be added to the program, and accounting staff can use the calculate feature to calculate the total work hours of each employee broken down by day for each month. This data is stored in a monthly Excel file with employees seperated by Excel sheet.

            <p>August, 2024</p>
            <p id="description-text">I consulted with the Principal of IKS International School about teaching a 2 day Summer Programming Course. The idea was presented to the parents, and many were interested with the course being fully booked (14 students) within 24 hours. The students who had no experience programming were taught the fundamentals of programming through 10 coding activities I designed. The course finished with a written exam I wrote, and students were awarded certificates of completion. The feedback from students and parents was very positive, and a regular weekly programming lesson has begun which I teach. The economic outcome of this summer course is that the school made a large profit for the 2 day course, and the ongoing weekly lessons. Additionally the school can advertise that it is the only school offering elementary aged programming lessons in Hokkaido.
